## How to install
 1. `curl -sSL https://pisupp.ly/brightpicode > script.sh`
 2. `chmod 775 script.sh`
 3. `./script.sh`

## Comments:
`curl -sSL https://pisupp.ly/brightpicode | bash` should work, but I haven't tested it. I am still not able to use it as [the website](https://learn.pi-supply.com/make/bright-pi-quickstart-faq/) which details which pins to connect the camera to is down.
