## Commands I ran:

 1. `sudo apt-get install pimoroni` This was a dead-end, but will leave it here for reference
 2. `pimoroni-dashboard` This was simply calling `curl`
 3. `sudo apt-get remove pimoroni`
 4. `sudo apt-get install python3-touchphat`
 5. Then I uninstalled it with `sudo apt-get remove python3-touchphat`
 
## Comments

It seems that I need to run `curl`.
